**CS 415 - Project 2 README**

**Group Members:** Christian Esperon and Alexandria Labossiere

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Since all of our code is in one file called project2.py, you just run that file.
You will be asked to choose which task you would like to run or if you would
like to quit. Assuming it is your first time running the code (you are not
quitting), you will enter 1 for karatsuba multiplication(task 1) or 2 for
exponentiation using karatsuba(task 2). Once you have done so, you will be prompted
to enter one number and then prompted to enter another number. Once those numbers
are entered, the input will be sent to the function of the task you chose to run
and will return the answer to in the form of a list. Once the answer is returned,
you will be asked which task you want to run or if you want to quit.

`Please Enter 1 for Karatsuba Multiplication, 2 for Exponentiation, or q to Quit.`
