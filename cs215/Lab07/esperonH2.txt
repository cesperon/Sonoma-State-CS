An idea I had about what I would like to add to the cell life game involes the concept of epidemic diseases. Everytime a new cell is born into the game it has a 15% chance of being infected with a fatal disease that can easily be caught by surrounding cells.If a reborn cell does happen to have contracted a disease it will automatically effect all of its surrounding neighbors, thus removing all the infected cells from the game board in the next generation.
